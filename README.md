# squirrels_data_analysis
Using pandas package to analyze center park squirrels data

I exported the data from: 

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw


This Data was collected and created by the squirrel census team : https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com

They counted squirrels in October of 2018 and present their findings to the public within their Central Park Squirrel Census 2019 Report. This report contains squirrel data for each of the 3,023 sightings, including location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities, communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans.


Using Pandas package, I generated a csv file to extract the amount of squirrels of each primary fur color.
